"""List every class and function a header in src/ declares, with the comment above it.

Clang parses the headers, so this reads real declarations rather than guessing at them
with a regular expression - templates, defaulted members, deleted operators and
multi-line signatures all arrive resolved, and access and deletedness are answered by the
compiler rather than inferred.

It uses libclang's cursor traversal, which is lazy. The JSON route this replaced was
tried first and abandoned on a measurement: `clang -ast-dump=json` on a header that
includes torch/torch.h emits 6.35 GB in 68 seconds, which no Python process can load.
The same header through a cursor takes 9.4 seconds at constant memory, and that is what
lets the LibTorch and raylib headers be covered at all. Do not go back to the JSON dump.

`-fparse-all-comments` is what makes clang attach the plain `//` blocks this repository
writes. Doxygen ignores every one of them, which is why it is not used here.

Coverage is reported per file, and a declaration with no comment is a finding. Presence
is the whole of what it measures. Whether a comment says anything worth reading is
settled by reading it.

Usage:

    python docs/api_surface.py                     # writes docs/src_api.html
    python docs/api_surface.py --check             # report only, write nothing
    python docs/api_surface.py --only mcts.h       # one file, printed to the terminal

Exit codes: 0 every required declaration carries a comment, 1 at least one does not,
2 libclang is missing or a header could not be parsed at all.

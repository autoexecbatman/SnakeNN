"""Index every file in src/ by the documentation block it already carries.

The convention here is that a file opens with a comment block saying what it is and how
to use it. That block is good and it is invisible: reading it means opening 69 files.
This collects them into one page, so the map exists without a second copy of the prose
that could drift from it.

It is also a coverage check. A file with no block is a finding and the script exits
non-zero, the way docs/analyze.ps1 and docs/check_headers.ps1 do. What it can measure is
presence - whether a block exists, whether it shows usage. Whether the block is any good
is a thing only reading it settles, and no tool here claims otherwise.

The output is generated, so it is not tracked: regenerate it rather than reading a copy
that stopped being true three commits ago.

Usage:

    python docs/build_index.py                  # writes docs/src_index.html
    python docs/build_index.py --out other.html # elsewhere
    python docs/build_index.py --check          # report coverage, write nothing

Exit codes: 0 every file carries a block, 1 at least one does not.
